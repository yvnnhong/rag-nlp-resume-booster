# My personal notes (to be deleted later -- temporary file)
## This is the draft version of dev_notes.md. 
Current to-do: 
in text_processor.py, the removal of duplicate words may backfire, since many ATS systems prioritize resumes (score these resumes higher) if they repeat important keywords in the job description
-todo: add a feature that lets the user drop in the job description, and then we can score 
their resume against that specific job description
(use counter or collections.defaultdict to track frequencies???)
Note: move everything in here into dev_notes.md This
